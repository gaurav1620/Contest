Problem statement

    There are n kattas in pvg (1,2,3,4.... n).
    There are also m roads in the format x,y that connect
    katta x and katta y.
    Also you have been given an array of n distinct numbers for which 
    the i'th element represents the beauty of the i'th katta

    There are n students admitted in PVG
    and as the CORONA pandemic is still going on each one of 
    them sits on a different katta. After the pandemic is over
    all the studnets try to explore new katttas that they can
    go to.

    NAAC is going to come to PVG to asses the grade which is 
    an integer. Interestingly NAAC computes the grade in the 
    following process : 
        NAAC asks each student the maximum beautiful katta 
        that he had seen till now and adds that students answer 
        to the database.
        After that NAAC pulls out all the unique values
        from this database and finds the summation 
        of these values to get the grade.

    You are the NAAC officer assignes to find the grade of PVG.
    Print a single integer which will be the grade of PVG.
